<h1>Chuck's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Halloween Edition</h2>
<hr />
<h3>An American Werewolf In London</h3>
<p>Probably the best film werewolf transformation ever. Griffin Dunne's supporting role is also a highlight.</p>

<h3>Shaun of the Dead</h3>
<p>Hilarious film with a great soundtrack and brilliant editing.  Many great one-liners, "You've got red on you."</p>

<h3>The Exorcist</h3>
<p>Amazing acting performances from all especially the young Linda Blair.  Also amazing and horrifying special effects far in advance of CGI technology.</p>

<h3>The Shining</h3>
<p>Not one of Stephen King's favored adaptations of his work but Kubrick's version of the story is a classic.  Jack Nicholson's axe weilding scene in the bathroom is legendary.</p>

<h3>The Thing</h3>
<p>Amazing and gruesome effects.  I love Kurt Russell in this very suspenseful and tense film.</p>
